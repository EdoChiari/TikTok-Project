# TikTok Claims Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to support TikTokâ€™s moderation team by classifying user-submitted content claims efficiently. By analyzing user reports on videos and comments, the project aims to build a model that distinguishes between content with user claims versus opinions. This approach will help TikTok reduce the backlog of reports, prioritize moderation efforts, and maintain a safe and engaging community.

## Project Goals
1. **Classify Content Claims**: Build and evaluate a model to predict whether a video contains a claim or an opinion, enabling TikTok to streamline content moderation.
2. **Enhance Moderation Efficiency**: Provide a scalable solution for handling high volumes of user reports, improving the speed and accuracy of content review processes.
3. **Deliver Insights for Stakeholders**: Generate actionable insights from user reports to aid TikTok leadership in understanding content trends and moderation needs.

## Deliverables
The final project deliverables include:

- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive assessment of the classification model, including accuracy, precision, and recall, to gauge its effectiveness in content claim prediction.
- **Data Visualizations**: Interactive Tableau dashboards summarizing user report trends, claim types, and other key insights, accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
- **Feature Analysis**: Examination of features that contribute most to accurate claim classification, with discussions on potential causative relationships.
- **Future Model Improvements**: Recommendations for additional features and data sources that may enhance the accuracy and relevance of the model.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (for regression and classification models)
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Preparation**: Building and organizing a comprehensive dataset from user reports for claims classification, ensuring data quality and suitability for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing user reports to identify claim patterns, trends, and factors that may impact claim classification.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducting hypothesis tests to determine the significance of various factors within user reports, informing model feature selection.
4. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Developing and testing a regression model to classify content claims, followed by evaluation using key performance metrics.
5. **Executive Summary**: A presentation-ready summary for stakeholders, highlighting findings, model performance, and potential impact on moderation efforts.

## Conclusion
This project offers TikTok a data-driven approach to improve content moderation by predicting user claims more effectively. With a model that enhances the prioritization of user reports, TikTok can maintain a safe, enjoyable platform while efficiently managing moderation resources.
